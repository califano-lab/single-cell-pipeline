Ajay removed the following genes from TF and coTF 'symbol' lists for mouse symbols because they are ribosomal genes and not know to have any transcriptional regulatory function. 
TFs:
Rpl7
Mrpl28

coTFs:
Rpl6
Rpl7l1
Rps14
Rps3
Rps6ka4
Rps6ka5
Mrpl12

The corresponding mouse TF and coTF gene-symbol-files have been changed. The gene-id-files have not been updated.
